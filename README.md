## Objectives
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

The company wants to know:

 - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
 - How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Business Goals

- Build the model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression
- It's required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables
- This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables
- They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns
- The model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market

## Conclusions
#### The optimal value of Ridge and Lasso is as below:

- Ridge: 1.0
- Lasso: 0.001

#### The mean squared value of Ridge and Lasso is as below

- Ridge: 0.12
- Lasso: 0.11

- The Mean Squared Error of Lasso is slightly lower than that of Ridge
- Lasso has a better edge over ridge as it helps in feature reduction
- The variables predicted by Lasso are significant variables for predicting the price of a house

##### I'll be condiering the Lasso Model as Final Model
